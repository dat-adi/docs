# September 2020
In the month of September, project "ForgeFedv2" started off by
initializing the lookup service, [Northstar](https://github.com/forgeflux-org/northstar/).

The initialization mostly comprised of setting up the CI environment,
and focused more on defining the structure of the project, and how
we were to be going about it.

A discussion on the terminology and the primitive method of the
project's functionality were discussed.
