# November 2020
Errors were modularized at the back of [Northstar](https://github.com/forgeflux-org/northstar/).
A Docker CI was set up for the Northstar builds.

A [GitHub organization](https://github.com/forgeflux-org) was created for ForgeFedv2, and the repositories for the projects were
transferred over to it.
